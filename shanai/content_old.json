The Ithaari were early masters of navigational science and seacraft, gaining naval dominance, joining the known world  together with trade. Though its land does not yield an abundance of resources, nor its population a vast army, Ithaar is undoubtedly the wealthiest country in Shanai through trade and a careful control of the seas. For a thousand years, Ithaar has been ruled by an order known as the faceless council. The council meets in secret, their identities unknown and members are appointed only after the death of a sitting member.",

    "description": "At a glance, the crystal blue waters around the island of Tenzu are a paradise, warm and teeming with beauty, but look closely and they are stained with blood. From his driftwood throne, the Pirate King of Tenzu terrorizes the southern seas of Shanai, plundering the wealth of the surrounding shores and sinking any ships that get in the way. While the promise of gold has been enough for most of history's pirates, Farazul seeks to fashion himself into a king, conquering an island and turning into a haven for robbers and thieves. There is fear among those in the area that the larger his following grows, the more bold he will become when he seeks a new target."

It is said that Sleet was once battered by storms year round. The buildings were built of stone, stout and simple to withstand wind and rain. That image of an ancient, rainy Sleet is hard to imagine today with its calm glassy waters and balmy weather. The people of the city are as warm and welcoming as the weather, keeping a rich culture of seafaring, music, and, above all else, food. Sleet is responsible for giving Shanai some of its greatest cooks and is the first place any lord comes to when looking for someone to run their kitchens. Sleet has a small navy that has been stretched to its limits since the Pirate King's occupation of Tenzu. With more crowded waters, the outdated Sleet ships find themselves skirmishing often with Crimson Sails, a losing battle the city cannot afford."

    "description": "An ancient seat of power in the east, Mercaia is one of the oldest countries in Shanai. At one point the borders of Mercaia contained much of the east, a period where house Vidalak had three generations of ascended Godkings on the Gilded Throne. The nearby hills were mined for gold and copper and it was said that their yields were so great that the masons added gold flecks to every brick so that the buildings would shimmer in the sunlight. In truth, the city owes its golden shine to the unique color of the sand of its beaches which happen to also be used in brick making. Today, the mines have dried up and Mercaia's borders have shrunken to include theÂ city of the same name and the nearby Hadria. The country is known more for its beauty rather than war or conquest. People come from all over to admire the city's architecture, enjoy the warm weather and bask on its golden beaches. Poets, painters, and musicians from all over flock to Mercaia, seeking to find their fame in the ale-slick taverns of the entertainment district."

Built by Hadron, the first king of Mercaia, the library is said to be so vast that it contains all the words ever written. Though this myth is easily disproven by the fact that archivists still return from all corners of Shanai with new additions. The city itself exists to sustain the archives, housing and feeding its sizeable staff, providing shelter and entertainment to visitors, and fulfilling research requests that come in from all of Shanai."

When they were swallowed by the Obsidian Empire, they were absorbed into a strict caste system and had their lands seized by wealthy colonials. They were forced into the mines, working in harsh conditions with little regard for safety. Many of them died. But from this hardship rose a hero called Alahar Navros, a bastard orphan from Yoros who gambled his life for freedom. Wielding a massive warpick, Alahar rallied the miners of his camp to overthrow their Tubul captors. This small ripple of a rebellion grew into something greater and soon all of Usol was free. Using his charisma, Alahar has also liberated Soule, weaponizing the anger of the common folk to overthrow their masters. With his following only growing there a fears that Alahar may spark a war in a region that has only known peace for a hundred years."

It wasn't until the Obsidian Empire poisoned the upstream water supply during a prolonged siege that Soule was finally defeated. For two hundred years, the Obsisdian Empire used Soule dwarves to build their walls and palaces, die in wars, and brew their mead. Currently in open rebellion against Godking Victarian the Younger, the people of Soule heard Alahar's call to arms and answered, overthrowing their masters and taking back their ancestral home."

Along with the port, Yllan is also home to the Stone Vault, a bank with a reserve of gold built safely into a mountain. The value of assets in the Stone Vault go beyond the count of any other, allowing the Yllani to satisfy the requirements for even the wealthiest clients. Despite the wealth it contains, Yllan is modest in its design. It's a clean city with simple, yet functional, architecture. The people are mostly of middle caste -- bankers, merchants, or skilled craftsmen."

In this hell, where seemingly nothing could survive, the explorers stumbled across a ruined city half buried in the ice. There seemed to be no end to the sprawling streets and crumbled buildings of the abandoned city, it stretched on as far as they could see. When members of their party started to go missing in the night, the expedition decided to return home -- they had lost enough people. Few explorers have returned from Umberfhel.

The Seleri are proud explorers, cartographers, and legendary weather workers who push the boundaries of the known world further with each expedition. Once a colony of Mercaia, the Selerians bartered for their independence by offering to build Mercaia one thousand ships.

Over time, they began to learn the ways of the desert and started to thrive. They soon called the desert home, building a city of sandstone and vowing never to be refugees again. Known for wielding the legendary Yakul, a curved sword made for hacking, Daruni warriors are feared for their ruthlessness in combat. They have incredible battle sense and are equally effective on their own as they are in ranks. The lands of Darun are alive with myserious forces, as is much of the desert. At night the Daruni believe spirits whisper in the valleys between dunes and demon maidens cry out in the night trying to lure victims out into the endless dark. The Daruni do not fear the deep desert so much as they respect and worship it. They'll only ever venture out in the light of the day and make offerings to Ket, shepherd of souls, a being they believe dwells under the sand."

It is a place where sailors can always find a warm meal and a dry bed -- a refuge to wait out storms. The people of Tivar are welcoming but keep to themselves. Most are members of the Cult of the Drowned Lady, a mysterious order that seems to fear the deep in the same breath it worships it.

Being so close to the Efretes, the land is steeped in a sorcery few can explain and even fewer can harness. Those that can should count themselves lucky to be in one of the few places in Shanai where such talents are fostered. Fledgling sorcerers are sent from their respective corners of Shanai to study under the tutelage of Yoros's many masters. Most go on to make a good living selling love potions, healing minor ailments, and casting luck cantrips for a few silver coins. But a select few serve in the hallowed courts of Godkings, command great fleets, or advise on matters of state. Though the extent of their sorcery is not known, the magi of Yoros are still as feared as they are mysterious."

The crown city itself breeds a strong lot, builders, miners, and soldiers. There is little time for poetry or politics, and in the harsh stony terrain of the mountains, sowing seeds is a futile effort. Tubul society has a strict caste system based on one's position at birth. Traversing this hierarchy, while not impossible, is rarely done. It is not uncommon for incumbent high ranking families to be nearly as old as the city itself. Frustrations with this caste system in the empire has led to the ongoing uprisings in the colonies, headed by Alahar the Yorosi."

In combat, the Sedhari favour light calvary, striking with spears and hide shields.

Those with the taste for fine wines swear by no other than a Kepean golden red, with some bottles being sold to collectors for over a thousand gold pieces. Kepe is also known for another export: archers. Kepean children learn to use a bow early in life, playing at target practice or simulating war with blunted arrows. It is no wonder that they grow up to become deadly shots. Though not a warfaring people themselves, Kepean archers have been known to earn riches fighting the wars of others."

What was originally a traditional practice passed down through generations quickly became a business opportunity when traders from Ithaar arrived in the village. The Ithaari were entranced by the light shiny fabric and offered gold to buy it off the backs of the Lyretheen. Hundreds of years later and Lyreth is the beating heart of the Silk Empire and the largest city in Shanai. It is said that it takes two whole days to cross from one end of the city to the other, not for the sheer size of it, but because it's streets are so dense with vendors and people. Because Lyreth is not a port city, all trade goods must pass through the Silk Port by way of road. While normally slow, the Lyretheen have designed their road system to be evenly paved and guarded by regular outposts, making travel along them safer and faster."

Long ago Graev was once the sole power in the region, ruled by the Farix line of Godkings. The fortress city was a marvel of ancient architecture and its army was unrivalled in size and in zeal. But once the silk trade began, Lyreth, growing fat and wealthy, set its sights on Graev. The bloody war lasted only two months, the house of Farix falling to a Lyrethi host of hired swords, spears, and bows. With each passing year, the magnificent city creeps deeper into ruin, still wearing the scars of a war two hundred years old. Any income from trade gets taxed and the council has few resources to make real change. But whispers of a hero from the Obsidian Empire called Alahar have reached Graev, the stories inspiring hope for liberation."

The unseen, unheard hand of Shai Yn's justice extended deep into the palaces of its enemies. Only one year after the founding of the House of Death, invaders stopped landing on Shai Yn's shores. Aside from its assassins, Shai Yn is known for its rich deposits of copper ore and its fishing trade, which sees thousands of barrels of salted Shai Minnows go out to all corners of Shanai where it's consumed as a delicacy."
