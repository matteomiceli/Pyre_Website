Though its land does not yield an abundance of resources, nor its population a vast army, Ithaar is undoubtedly the wealthiest country in Shanai through trade and a careful control of the seas. For a thousand years, Ithaar has been ruled by an order known as the faceless council. The council meets in secret, their identities unknown and members are appointed only after the death of a sitting member.",

While the promise of gold has been enough for most of history's pirates, Farazul seeks to fashion himself into a king, conquering an island and turning into a haven for robbers and thieves. There is fear among those in the area that the larger his following grows, the more bold he will become when he seeks a new target.",

The people of the city are as warm and welcoming as the weather, keeping a rich culture of seafaring, music, and, above all else, food. Sleet is responsible for giving Shanai some of its greatest cooks and is the first place any lord comes to when looking for someone to run their kitchens. Sleet has a small navy that has been stretched to its limits since the Pirate King's occupation of Tenzu. With more crowded waters, the outdated Sleet ships find themselves skirmishing often with Crimson Sails, a losing battle the city cannot afford.",

In truth, the city owes its golden shine to the unique color of the sand of its beaches which happen to also be used in brick making. Today, the mines have dried up and Mercaia's borders have shrunken to include the\u00a0city of the same name and the nearby Hadria. The country is known more for its beauty rather than war or conquest. People come from all over to admire the city's architecture, enjoy the warm weather and bask on its golden beaches.
